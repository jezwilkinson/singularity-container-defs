%help
This is a minimal container for running Hipe4ML (0.0.7) with XGBoost, including NVidia GPU support with CUDA 11.0. Based on the official CUDA image from NVidia, https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda. 
NOTE: If using a GPU method in XGBoost such as "gpu_tree", the container must be run with the --nv switch (e.g. "singularity exec --nv [COMMAND]") in order to access the driver binaries on the host machine.
This environment is also compatible with CPU-only running of Hipe4ML on any host machine, without any additional setup.
version 1.0.2: xxhash support, fix issue with LLVM compilation
